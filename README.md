Schulte-table (HTML/CSS/JavaScripts)


The Schulte Table game is a mental speed and agility exercise that helps improve concentration and visual perception skills. It involves finding and clicking on numbers in ascending order within a grid.

The JavaScript implementation on GitHub provides a user-friendly interface for playing the game. It generates a random grid of numbers from 1 to N, where N is the size of the grid specified by the user. The grid is displayed on the screen, and the player's task is to locate and click on the numbers in ascending order, starting from 1 and ending at N.

The game keeps track of the player's time and displays it on the screen, allowing them to track their progress and compete against their own records. It also provides a timer to limit the player's time for completing the table, adding an additional challenge to the game.

The GitHub repository contains all the necessary JavaScript code, HTML markup, and CSS styling to create a functional and visually appealing Schulte Table game. It can be easily downloaded, modified, and deployed on any web server or run locally in a web browser.

By playing the Schulte Table game implemented in JavaScript, users can enhance their mental agility, improve focus and concentration, and have fun while challenging themselves to beat their previous records.
